Title:TexEditor: Structure-Preserving Text-Driven Texture Editing
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Text-guided texture editing aims to modify object appearance while preserving the underlying geometric structure. However, our empirical analysis reveals that even SOTA editing models frequently struggle to maintain structural consistency during texture editing, despite the intended changes being purely appearance-related. Motivated by this observation, we jointly enhance structure preservation from both data and training perspectives, and build TexEditor, a dedicated texture editing model based on Qwen-Image-Edit-2509. Firstly, we construct TexBlender, a high-quality SFT dataset generated with Blender, which provides strong structural priors for a cold start. Sec- ondly, we introduce StructureNFT, a RL-based approach that integrates structure-preserving losses to transfer the structural priors learned during SFT to real-world scenes. Moreover, due to the limited realism and evaluation coverage of existing benchmarks, we introduce TexBench, a general-purpose real-world benchmark for text-guided texture editing. Extensive experiments on existing Blender-based texture benchmarks and our TexBench show that TexEditor consistently outperforms strong baselines such as Nano Banana Pro. In addition, we assess TexEditor on the general purpose benchmark ImgEdit to validate its generalization. Our code and data are available at this https URL.
