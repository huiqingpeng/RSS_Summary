Title:Cell-Type Prototype-Informed Neural Network for Gene Expression Estimation from Pathology Images
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Estimating slide- and patch-level gene expression profiles from pathology images enables rapid and low-cost molecular analysis with broad clinical impact. Despite strong results, existing approaches treat gene expression as a mere slide- or spot-level signal and do not incorporate the fact that the measured expression arises from the aggregation of underlying cell-level expression. To explicitly introduce this missing cell-resolved guidance, we propose a Cell-type Prototype-informed Neural Network (CPNN) that leverages publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. Since single-cell measurements are noisy and not paired with histology images, we first estimate cell-type prototypes-mean expression profiles that reflect stable gene-gene co-variation this http URL then learns cell-type compositional weights directly from images and models the relationship between prototypes and observed bulk or spatial expression, providing a biologically grounded and structurally regularized prediction framework. We evaluate CPNN on three slide-level datasets and three patch-level spatial transcriptomics datasets. Across all settings, CPNN achieves the highest performance in terms of Spearman correlation. Moreover, by visualizing the inferred compositional weights, our framework provides interpretable insights into which cell types drive the predicted expression.
