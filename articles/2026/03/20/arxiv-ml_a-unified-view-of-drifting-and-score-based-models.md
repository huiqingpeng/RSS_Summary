Title:A Unified View of Drifting and Score-Based Models
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Drifting models train one-step generators by optimizing a mean-shift discrepancy induced by a kernel between the data and model distributions, with Laplace kernels used by default in practice. At each point, this discrepancy compares the kernel-weighted displacement toward nearby data samples with the corresponding displacement toward nearby model samples, yielding a transport direction for generated samples. In this paper, we make its relationship to the score-matching principle behind diffusion models precise by showing that drifting admits a score-based formulation on kernel-smoothed distributions. For Gaussian kernels, the population mean-shift field coincides with the score difference between the Gaussian-smoothed data and model distributions. This identity follows from Tweedie's formula, which links the score of a Gaussian-smoothed density to the corresponding conditional mean, and implies that Gaussian-kernel drifting is exactly a score-matching-style objective on smoothed distributions. It also clarifies the connection to Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD): both methods use score-mismatch transport directions, but drifting realizes the score signal nonparametrically from kernel neighborhoods, whereas DMD uses a pretrained diffusion teacher. Beyond Gaussians, we derive an exact decomposition for general radial kernels, and for the Laplace kernel we prove rigorous error bounds showing that drifting remains an accurate proxy for score matching in low-temperature and high-dimensional regimes.
