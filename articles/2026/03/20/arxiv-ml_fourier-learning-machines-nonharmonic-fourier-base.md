Title:Fourier Learning Machines: Nonharmonic Fourier-Based Neural Networks for Scientific Machine Learning
View PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN) architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first architecture able to represent a multidimensional Fourier series with a complete set of basis functions in separable form, doing so by using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full, separable basis form and the cosine phase-shifted one. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems, including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.
